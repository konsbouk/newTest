This is a small exercise for QA software engineers. It provides with an HTML page with embeded JS scripts and an extra CSS file.

### The challenge

- Set up this project with your preffered tools
- Read the code and identify the use cases. Create automation tests for all of them.
- Update the Run Project Guidlines section of the README file, with instructions for running the project and tests
- Use utility classes and/or page object model classes based on the OOP paradigm to structure the solution into reusable blocks of code
